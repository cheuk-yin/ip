# UI Test Plan

This file drives the `test-ui` skill (`.claude/skills/test-ui/`), which
replays these test cases against the compiled `Buddy` program and checks
the real console output against what's recorded here.

**Important — read before adding a test case:**
- All test cases run as **one continuous Buddy session**. Each test case's
  `Input` lines are appended to every earlier test case's input before
  Buddy is re-run, so task state (added tasks, marked/unmarked status)
  carries over from one test case to the next, exactly like a real user
  typing commands one after another.
- A test case's `Expected Output` is only the **new** console output
  produced by that test case's own input — not a repeat of earlier test
  cases' output.
- Exception: Buddy prints a one-time startup banner before it reads any
  input at all. Since Test Case 1 is the very first thing that happens in
  the session, its `Expected Output` must include that banner block too.
  Later test cases never repeat it.

See the `test-ui` skill (`.claude/skills/test-ui/SKILL.md`) for the exact
format template to copy when adding a new test case below.

## Add a todo (and see the startup banner)

**Aim:** Starting Buddy and adding a single todo shows the startup banner followed by an add-confirmation.

**Input:**
```text
todo read book
```

**Expected Output:**
```text
____________________________________________________________
 ____   _   _  ____   ____  __   __
| __ ) | | | ||  _ \ |  _ \ \ \ / /
|  _ \ | | | || | | || | | | \ V / 
| |_) || |_| || |_| || |_| |  | |  
|____/  \___/ |____/ |____/   |_|
